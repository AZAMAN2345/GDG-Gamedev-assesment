**Novice (Comfortable with basics: variables, functions, simple logic)**
Focus: Reinforcing fundamentals, understanding core game loops.

**Avoid the Obstacles**
Goal: Control a player character (a square/circle) with keyboard or mouse. Random obstacles (other squares) fall from the top. The game ends on collision.

Core Concepts: Player input, collision detection, game state (playing/game over), basic game object spawning.

1-Hour Version: Player movement and a single falling obstacle. Simple collision.

**Intermediate (Comfortable with OOP, basic APIs, and multiple systems)**
2-Hour Version: Multiple obstacles, a score that increases over time, and a "Game Over" screen.
2. Local High Score & Save System
Goal: Take a simple existing game (like the Novice "Avoid the Obstacles") and implement a system that saves the top 5 high scores to a file (JSON, XML, or PlayerPrefs).

Core Concepts: Data persistence, serialization, file I/O, sorting algorithms.

1-Hour Version: Save and load a single "Best Score."

2-Hour Version: A full top-5 list that displays on a leaderboard screen.
